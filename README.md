# Interior Design Showcase

This project is part of an assignment for the Bahçeşehir University Wissen Akademie Software Specialist course. The goal of this project was to create a modern, responsive web application using a template from W3Schools. The selected template showcases an interior design company's services, team, packages, and contact information.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to practice and demonstrate the ability to apply pre-designed templates to a web application, ensuring the layout is responsive and visually appealing. The project helps in understanding the structure and customization of HTML and CSS, particularly using the W3.CSS framework.

## Features

- **Responsive Sidebar Menu**: A collapsible sidebar that provides easy navigation across different sections of the site.
- **Photo Grid Gallery**: An interactive photo grid that displays images of interior designs. Clicking on an image opens a modal with a larger view and caption.
- **Services Section**: Details about the services offered by the interior design company.
- **Designers Section**: Information about the team members, showcasing their roles and expertise.
- **Packages/Pricing**: Different service packages with detailed pricing and benefits.
- **Contact Form**: A simple contact form for users to reach out to the company.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling the website and making it responsive.
- **W3.CSS**: A modern CSS framework for a fast and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements such as the sidebar and modal image gallery.
